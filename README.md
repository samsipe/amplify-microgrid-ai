# Amplify Microgrid AI

## Overview
**This project aims to modernize how buildings interact with the grid**, utilizing deep learning techniques to predict future usage and generation to make smarter energy decisions.

## Installation
Run the following command to get `amplify` installed in your environment.

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Training
CLI functionality has been added to this python module so you can run the following.

``` shell
amplify --version
```

## Jupyter Notebooks

These are found [here](notebooks/) and  used for development and testing. All functionality should be migrated to [amplify/train.py](amplify/train.py)
